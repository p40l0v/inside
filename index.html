        <h4> In your hand you have the eleventh issue of the INSIDE magazine, the works and thoughts of the Master Interior Architecture of the Dutch Royal Academy of Art.</h4>
        <p> Every year at INSIDE we choose a year theme as an impulse to the curriculum to explore a specific phenomenon in the built environment. We could not have imagined when we decided upon Fruitful Inefficiency as this year's theme, it would be relevant not only to our program but to society as a whole; at least as far as the term inefficiency concerns. As a result of the covid-19 crisis, the global society was extremely restricted in its freedom of movement. Also our program moved from the INSIDE studio space in The Hague to the digital world of Teams, Zoom and Skype. However, our year theme Fruitful Inefficiency was not provoked by this years pandemic, but inspired by a student who graduated from INSIDE in 2019. In his first year, I-Chieh Liu designed a very inefficient coffee ceremony within raumlabors Floating University project in Berlin.</p>
        <p>The guests who took part in the ceremony had to prepare everything by hand, and even had to make fire using an inefficient prehistoric wooden    construction that I-Chieh had designed and built. In this way the ceremony became much more than just drinking coffee together; the ineptitude brought the guests closer together in the preparation of the event. It reminded me of a journey I once made with the director of Polis University in Tirana, Besnik Aliaj, who drove me by car for a lecture series from Tirana in Albania to Sarajevo in Bosnia. He knew the road until halfway, Podgorica, the capitol of Montenegro. In this city I found an old fashioned printed map in a bookshop, perfectly showing the route through the mountains between Podgorica and Sarajevo. </p>
        <p>To my surprise Besnik refused to use the map. Instead, he drove up to pedestrians, opened his window and asked for directions. Even when we were demonstrably steered in the wrong direction by our informants, he persisted in his strategy. When I asked him a bit annoyed why, he answered that he did it on purpose to hear more than the route but also to get to know the gestures, smells, language and customs of the people of the country. Obviously, by looking at the map in his air-conditioned car, these would have completely escaped him. </p>

        <p>The online education we had to switch to halfway through this academic year, is like driving through a fascinating landscape in a sealed and fully air-conditioned car with light brown windows. Scent, tactile sensations, humidity, light, temperatures, meaningful body movements and other tangible expressions are lost as essential information, and just the image and voice remain. Although the digital world has endless storage capacity, computer communication leaves no physical traces. When the conversation is over, all that remains is silence, emptiness and maybe some megabytes on a hard disk somewhere that only contribute to the longing for the next meeting. Through the covid-19 crisis, culture showed its resilience. People turned out to be able to use their inefficient situations fruitfully: balcony concerts were organized, priests placed photographs of absent believers in their empty benches and forbidden funerals were transformed into hedges of honour with the streets filled with family and friends who, at an appropriate distance, cheered the deceased. The so-called one-and-a-half-metre society turned out to be an interesting challenge for spatial designers. Precisely these forced restrictions are able to cause unexpected innovations and new social relationships, a value that cannot be expressed in monetary terms.</p>
        <p>Also the INSIDE students appeared to be able to use the limitations of the situations they had to deal with in an extraordinary way. Models were built within studentsâ€™ rooms and amazing presentation films were edited, where the limitations functioned as extra features. The crisis implied that our planned project in Albania in collaboration with Polis University had to be radically changed and some graduating students had to fundamentally adapt their spatial research to the forced limitations. Despite these challenging circumstances, exciting projects with fascinating presentations emerged. I would therefore like to compliment all our students on their perseverance and resilience. I also have to thank all our tutors, (guest)lecturers and facilitators at the KABK for their ingenuity and willingness to make extra efforts. It fills me with pride to be the head of INSIDE.</p>
        <p>  In this magazine we present a selection of the results of this year's INSIDE programme. It includes the first year studios with Studio Makkink & Bey, MVRDV and Gerjan Streng in collaboration with Benjamin Foerster-Baldenius of raumlaborberlin. It shows the results of the Flows Program of Superuse, the Theory program of Anne Hoogewoning and the Travel program that I'm privileged to assemble every year. The publication also includes two interviews of first-year students with special people they met. Moreover, I am very pleased with the fact that, besides the editorial team consisting of Anne Hoogewoning, Lotte van den Berg and myself, exhibition tutor Paul Kuipers, Tim Devos and alumni Klodiana Millona and Jack Bardwell were willing to contribute with their sharp thoughts to this publication. </p>

      <h4> In your hand you have the eleventh issue of the INSIDE magazine, the works and thoughts of the Master Interior Architecture of the Dutch Royal Academy of Art. Every year at INSIDE we choose a year theme as an impulse to the
        curriculum to explore a specific phenomenon in the built environment. </h4>
      <p>We could not have imagined when we decided upon Fruitful Inefficiency as this year's theme, it would be relevant not only to our program but to society as a whole; at least as far as the term inefficiency concerns. As a result
        of the covid-19 crisis, the global society was extremely restricted in its freedom of movement. Also our program moved from the INSIDE studio space in The Hague to the digital world of Teams, Zoom and Skype.</p>
